In the past month, I have learnt how to use the following in Java:

    Classes
    Methods

I have used these concepts in the program called 'BkRecmClass.java'.

Strengths: I was able to create the book class and its different methods fairly easily.

Weaknesses: I found it tricky to apply the book class that I created as it felt quite unnatural to use an object for the functionality of the program. However, once achieved, it felt quite satisfying as it was an elegant solution.
