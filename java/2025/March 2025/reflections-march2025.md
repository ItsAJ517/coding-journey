In the past month, I have developed my understanding of the following:

    Data types
    Operators

I have applied these concepts in the program 'LogicalOpTable.java'.

Strengths: I quickly understood the different data types as they were quite similar to the ones in Python.

Weaknesses: Since there are a wider range of operators in Java, it took me longer to understand their uses.
