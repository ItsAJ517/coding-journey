In the past few months, I developed my understanding of the following in Java:

    Selection statements
    Iteration
    Basic I/O

I have used these concepts in the file called 'HelpSystem.java'.

Strengths: I applied basic I/O and iteration in multiple smaller programs effectively.

Weaknesses: I didn't immediately understand the "break label;" and "continue label;" statements, as they seemed pointless at first.
