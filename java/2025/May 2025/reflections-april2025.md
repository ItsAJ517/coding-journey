In the past few months, I developed my understanding of the following in Java:

    Selection statements
    Iteration
    Basic I/O

I have used these concepts in the file called 'BookRecommendations.java'. This program is similar to one that is shown in the book that I am using to learn Java. That program displays the general form of the various program control statemets in Java, such is 'if' and 'for'. However, I made this program from scratch.

Strengths: I applied basic I/O and iteration in multiple smaller programs effectively.

Weaknesses: I didn't immediately understand the "break label;" and "continue label;" statements, as they seemed pointless at first.
