In the past month, I have revisited some core programming concepts, but this time in Java. These include:

    Output
    Data types
    Mathematical operations
    Selection statements
    Iteration

I have applied all of these concepts in the program 'GalToLitTable.java'.

Strengths: I understood the different data types and their purposes quite well. I also used the mathematical operations well, as they were the same as Python.

Weaknesses: I had trouble understanding 'for' loops as they required much more syntax than in Python. I would also often forget to end my lines in semicolons, which would lead to many errors.

Other insights: I have noticed that Java is a much more strict and robust language than Python. This is due to the increased syntax such as:

    Specifying types when initializing variables
    Increased number of variable types

I have also noticed that strings can be concatenated much easier since the variable types can all be different while concatenating. This was one of my main weaknesses when I started learning Python.
