In the past month, I decided to recap the programming skills that I have learnt in Java so far. This is because I was primarily focused on making a 
personal finance tracker in Python, and I had not practiced Java programming for a while.

I have refreshed my memory by making a small music quiz program. This can be found in the folder 'Music Quiz'.
