This folder contains my milestones in Java development.

Since Java is not a language I learn in school, I will be learning it at home through reading.

I have chosen Java as it provides a strong foundation on object-oriented programming principles.

Most of the files can be run by compiling:

    javac Filename.java

and executing (make sure Java is installed):

    java Filename

However, some files may have additional requirements - please check the comments at the top of each file.
