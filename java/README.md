This folder contains my milestones in Java development.

Since Java is not a language I learn in school, I will be learning it at home through reading.

I have chosen Java as it provides a strong foundation on object-oriented programming principles.

Most of the files can be run directly in the command line. However, some files may require additional libraries to be installed - please check the comments at the top of each file.
