In the past month, I have learnt the following programming concepts in Python:

    Lists
    List methods

I have used all the concepts that I have learnt so far in the program 'shopping_list.py', which is my largest programme yet.

Strengths: I quickly understood how to use lists and the different list methods. I also applied other concepts (e.g. iteration and indexing) to lists, as shown in 'shopping_list.py'.

Weaknesses: I would rely heavily on comments to understand what my programme did. I also believed this would make it easier for others to understand my code. However, I eventually mitigated my use of comments (as shown in 'shopping_list.py') as a heavy use of comments would make my program even harder to comprehend.
