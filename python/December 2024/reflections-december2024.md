In the past month, I have learnt the following programming concepts in Python:

    Lists
    List methods

I have used all the concepts that I have learnt so far in the program 'shopping_list.py', which is my largest program yet.

Strengths: I quickly understood how to use lists and the different list methods. I also applied other concepts (e.g. iteration) to lists, as shown in the shopping list program.

Weaknesses: Although I can't identify any specific weaknesses at this point, I know that programming is a continuous learning journey and I'm looking forward to exploring more complex data structures and concepts.
