In the past month, I have learnt basic Python programming concepts in school such as:

    Input and output
    String concatenation
    Type conversion
    Using the 'random' module

I have put these concepts into practice in the program called 'password_generator.py'.

Strengths: I used I/O well and I controlled variables using certain string methods.

Weaknesses: I had some trouble with type conversion as I didn't understand why it's necessary to change variable types for certain operations.
