In the past month, I have learnt some of the core programming concepts in Python such as:

    Input and output
    String concatenation
    Type conversion
    Using the 'random' module

I have put these concepts into practice in the program called 'password_generator.py'.

Strengths: I used I/O well and I controlled variables using certain string methods.

Weaknesses: Sometimes I would forget to change the types of variables for certain operations, which led to a lot of errors.
