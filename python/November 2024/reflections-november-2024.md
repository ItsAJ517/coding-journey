In the past month, I have learnt various new programming concepts in Python such as:

    Selection
    Iteration
    String methods and escape characters

I have used these skills in the programme called 'presents.py'.

Strengths: I made good use of escape characters, which would make my programs more user-friendly. I also used iteration quite well and noticed that it made my programs much shorter, while also adding a noticeable level of complexity.

Weaknesses: Sometimes I would encounter errors while using selection statements inside loops and string slicing. However, these issues were quicky overcome as I created more and more programmes.
