In the past month, I have expanded my knowledge of programming concepts in Python by learning the following:

    Extracting data from CSV files
    Writing data to CSV files
    Presenting data from external files

This also introduced the concept of 2D lists. I particularly enjoyed learning these skills and have used them in the program 'cereal_data.py', which can be found in the folder named 'Cereal Data'.

Strengths: I used iteration quite well in order to find the data required from the list. I have also made my comments brief and professional.

Weaknesses: Double indexing with 2D lists was tricky at first, but it became relatively easy after some practice.
