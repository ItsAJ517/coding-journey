In the past month, I have not learnt any new programming skills in Python. However, I have learnt how to use all the concepts I already know to make even larger and more complex programs.

Over the past month, I have primarily focused on making a music quiz game called 'music_quiz.py', which is a large program that uses multiple other files as well. These can be found in the folder named 'Music Quiz'.
