In the past month, I have not learnt any new programming skills in Python. However, I have learnt how to use all the concepts I already know to make even larger and more complex programs.

I have primarily focused on making a music quiz game called 'music_quiz.py', which is a complex program that uses multiple other files as well. These can be found in the folder named 'Music Quiz'.

Strengths: I also use a loop control variable instead of "while True:" for complex infinite loops.

Weaknesses: My login system could be improved by adding a login/signup option. I initially avoided this to prevent duplicate accounts, but that can be handled by prompting users to choose a different username or password.
