In the past few months, I have made a personal finance tracker. The program can be found in the folder 'Personal Finance Tracker'.

While making this program, I taught myself how to use some new modules such as:

    Using JSON for files instead of CSV
    datetime/calendar

I used JSON because I realized that using CSV files would not be the best approach to saving every user's data. I researched other ways to store user data in the format I wished and found that JSON would be the best choice. It's clean, compact, and easy to use.

Strengths: I quickly learnt the JSON and datetime module and used them effectively. I also implemented error handling with ease.

Weaknesses: my biggest weakness was putting all my code into different functions after hard coding it into each of the options. This was a very tedious task which included many rounds of debugging. However, in the end, this was definitely a great choice. As I started to add more options to the program, the functions proved to be much more helpful than I would've initially thought.
