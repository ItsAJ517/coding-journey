In the past month, I have learnt various new programming concepts in Python such as:

    Selection
    Iteration
    String methods and escape characters

I have used these skills in the programme called 'presents.py'.

Strengths: I made good use of escape characters to make my programs more user-friendly. I also understood iteration quickly.

Weaknesses: Sometimes I would have trouble while adding selection statements inside loops.
