In the past month, I have learnt the following in Python:

    Functions

Although I haven't learnt many new concepts, I learnt how to make large programs that apply all the concepts that I have learnt so far. This is demonstrated in the program 'rock_paper_scissors.py'.

Strengths: I made good utility of functions to condense my programs even further. I also applied some mathematical concepts in 'rock_paper_scissors.py' while checking if the user has won.
